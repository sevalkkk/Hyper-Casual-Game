# Hyper-Casual-Game
 
The player collects the pieces of wood he finds on the ground and gets a cylinder. 
The sizes of these cylinders get smaller when they hit different traps. 
The goal is to get the maximum amount of rollers we get to the finish line. 
The game consists of 3 Levels for now. Sound effects have not been added yet.
